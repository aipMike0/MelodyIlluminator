Introduction

"Melody Illuminator" is an innovative implementation of an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)-based LED control system using the MSP432P401R microcontroller. This project leverages the ARM CMSIS DSP library to analyze audio signals and dynamically control LEDs according to the frequency characteristics of the input signal. It's an intersection of audio processing and visual feedback.
